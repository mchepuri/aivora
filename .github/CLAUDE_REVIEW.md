# Claude Code Review Rules — Aivora

This file is read at runtime by the Claude Code review GitHub Action.
Edit it to change what the reviewer focuses on. No workflow changes needed.

## Context

Aivora is a Next.js 14 (App Router) + NestJS 10 monorepo for AI-enabled Supply Chain Management.
Stack: TypeScript strict · Tailwind CSS v4 · Prisma 5 · PostgreSQL · npm workspaces.

## Always check

### Security (block PR if any of these are found)
- No secrets, API keys, or tokens hardcoded in source files
- No raw SQL string concatenation — Prisma parameterised queries only
- Every authenticated route must verify the JWT before touching the database
- Never trust client-supplied `userId` or `tenantId` — read from verified JWT only
- Sensitive fields (bank details, tax IDs, cost prices) must not appear in list endpoints without explicit permission checks
- No `console.log` of request bodies or user data (PII leak risk)

### TypeScript
- No `any` types — use `unknown` + narrowing guards where the type is truly unknown
- No `any` on request/response objects
- DTO fields must use definite assignment assertions (`!`) for required fields populated by `ValidationPipe`

### Backend — NestJS
- Controllers must contain zero business logic — only routing, status codes, and request/response shaping
- All DTO fields must have `class-validator` decorators (`@IsString()`, `@MaxLength()`, etc.)
- `@MaxLength()` is required on every string field
- Prisma errors must be caught and mapped: `P2002` → `ConflictException`, `P2025` → `NotFoundException`
- Import `PrismaClientKnownRequestError` from `@prisma/client/runtime/library` (not from the `Prisma` namespace)
- Raw Prisma errors must never bubble to the HTTP layer
- Every query must be scoped by `tenantId` — no cross-tenant data leakage

### Frontend — Next.js
- Default to Server Components; `'use client'` only when browser APIs, event handlers, or hooks are required
- Initial data fetching must use `async/await` in Server Components — no `useEffect + fetch` pattern
- All API calls must go through `apps/web/lib/apiClient.ts` — no direct `fetch` calls
- Loading and error states must be handled explicitly — never silently swallow errors
- The `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` on the `(authenticated)` layout must not be removed

### Architecture (flag any violation — do not auto-approve)
- `inventory_ledger`, `gl_journal_*`, `audit_logs`, `tax_transactions` are append-only — no UPDATE or DELETE
- Every financial transaction must produce balanced GL entries (net zero)
- Multi-tenant: every DB query must be scoped by `tenant_id`

---

## Style / maintainability

- No `console.log` in committed code — use NestJS `Logger` in the API
- No commented-out code
- No TODOs unless they reference a GitHub issue: `// TODO(#42): ...`
- Files must stay under 300 lines — flag files approaching this
- Functions must do one thing — flag functions whose purpose requires "and" to describe

---

## What NOT to flag

- Formatting / whitespace (handled by the linter)
- Minor naming preferences when the existing name is clear
- Speculative future improvements not required by the PR
